# Canadian University Basketball Minutes Predictor

A machine learning pipeline for predicting player minutes in Canadian University basketball games using historical performance data and feature engineering.

## üèÄ Project Overview

This project adapts and extends the NBA Minutes Predictor methodology to Canadian University basketball data. The pipeline processes player box score data, engineers predictive features, and compares multiple machine learning models to predict player minutes in upcoming games.

**Key Features:**
- **Feature Engineering**: Rolling averages, exponential weighted moving averages, efficiency metrics
- **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and baseline methods
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust evaluation with 5-fold cross-validation
- **Visualization**: Comprehensive performance analysis and feature importance plots
- **Baseline Analysis**: Comparison with simple rolling average methods

## üìä Results Summary

**Best Model Performance:**
- **Linear Regression**: R¬≤ = 0.640 (64.0% accuracy)
- **Random Forest**: R¬≤ = 0.644 (64.4% accuracy)
- **LightGBM**: R¬≤ = 0.642 (64.2% accuracy)

**Key Findings:**
- Machine learning models significantly outperform simple rolling averages (89.8% improvement)
- Feature engineering provides tremendous predictive value
- Linear Regression captures complex patterns while maintaining interpretability
- Cross-validation confirms reliable performance estimates

## üîß Feature Engineering

**Engineered Features:**
- **Rolling Averages**: 3, 5, and 10-game windows for key statistics
- **Exponential Weighted Moving Averages**: Multiple alpha values (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5)
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Usage rate, true shooting percentage, effective field goal percentage
- **Per-Minute Statistics**: Points, assists, rebounds per minute
- **Player Rating**: Composite performance metric

**Time-Series Handling:**
- All features are properly shifted to prevent data leakage
- Only historical data is used to predict future minutes
- Chronological processing ensures temporal integrity

### Baseline Comparison

- **Linear Regression vs. 5-Game Rolling Average**: 89.8% improvement  
- **Linear Regression vs. 3-Game Rolling Average**: 140.6% improvement  
- **Feature engineering adds substantial predictive power** in the context of sports analytics.

![Baseline Comparison](results/baseline_comparison_canadian.png)

- Linear Regression consistently outperforms rolling averages across all evaluation metrics ‚Äî including mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R¬≤ score.

![Prediction Comparison](results/prediction_comparison_plots_canadian.png)

- The scatterplot demonstrates that Linear Regression predictions are much more concentrated and closely aligned with the actual minutes played, compared to rolling average methods.
