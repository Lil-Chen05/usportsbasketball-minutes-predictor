- ✅ **Statistical rigor** is required

### **Rolling Averages Best For:**
- ✅ **Small datasets** (< 100 records)
- ✅ **Quick predictions** with minimal computational cost
- ✅ **Interpretable results** (easy to explain)
- ✅ **When only basic data** is available
- ✅ **Real-time predictions** with limited features

## 🔮 **Practical Recommendations**

### **For Canadian University Basketball:**
1. **Use Linear Regression** as primary prediction method
2. **Implement feature engineering** pipeline for best results
3. **Monitor performance** as more data becomes available
4. **Consider ensemble methods** combining multiple approaches

### **Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Primary method: Linear Regression
def predict_minutes_ml(player_features, model):
    return model.predict(player_features)

# Backup method: Rolling Average
def predict_minutes_rolling(player_history, window=5):
    return player_history['Mins'].rolling(window=window).mean().iloc[-1]

# Ensemble approach
def predict_minutes_ensemble(ml_pred, rolling_pred, weight=0.8):
    return weight * ml_pred + (1 - weight) * rolling_pred
```
