# Canadian University Basketball Minutes Prediction Pipeline

## Overview

This document summarizes the adaptation of the NBA minutes prediction repository for Canadian University basketball data. The original repository was designed for NBA data (2012-18_playerBoxScore.csv) and has been successfully adapted to work with Canadian University basketball data (2022-24_playerBoxScore.csv).

## Key Adaptations Made

### 1. Data Structure Differences

**Original NBA Dataset:**
- 155,714 records, 51 columns
- Target variable: `playMin` (minutes played)
- Rich feature set with detailed player and team statistics

**Canadian University Dataset:**
- 39,586 records, 30 columns (41% fewer features)
- Target variable: `Mins` (minutes played)
- Simplified feature set with core basketball statistics

### 2. Column Mapping

| NBA Column | Canadian Column | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| `playMin` | `Mins` | Minutes played (target variable) |
| `playPTS` | `Pts` | Points scored |
| `playAST` | `AST` | Assists |
| `playTO` | `TO` | Turnovers |
| `playSTL` | `STL` | Steals |
| `playBLK` | `BLK` | Blocks |
| `playTRB` | `Reb_T` | Total rebounds |
| `playFGA` | `FGA` | Field goal attempts |
| `playFGM` | `FGM` | Field goals made |
| `playFTA` | `FTA` | Free throw attempts |
| `playFTM` | `FTM` | Free throws made |
| `playFG%` | `FG_Pct` | Field goal percentage |
| `playFT%` | `FT_Pct` | Free throw percentage |
| `play3P%` | `3PT_Pct` | Three-point percentage |
| `play3PA` | `3PTA` | Three-point attempts |
| `play3PM` | `3PTM` | Three-point makes |

### 3. Feature Engineering Adaptations

**New Features Created:**
- `PlayerRating`: Composite player performance metric
- `UsageRate`: Player usage rate based on field goal attempts, free throws, and turnovers
- `TrueShootingPct`: True shooting percentage (from `TS_Pct`)
- `EffectiveFGPct`: Effective field goal percentage (from `eFG_Pct`)
- `PtsPerMin`: Points per minute
- `AstPerMin`: Assists per minute
- `RebPerMin`: Rebounds per minute

**Rolling Features:**
- Windows: [3, 5, 10] (reduced from [5, 20] due to smaller dataset)
- Aggregation functions: ['mean', 'median'] (added mean for more features)
- Features: Minutes, PlayerRating, UsageRate, TrueShootingPct, EffectiveFGPct, PtsPerMin, AstPerMin, RebPerMin

**EWM Features:**
- Alpha values: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5] (reduced from [0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7])
- Mean EWM for all rolling features
- Standard deviation EWM for minutes only

### 4. Model Adaptations

**Cross-Validation:**
- Implemented 5-fold cross-validation with KFold
- Shuffle=True, random_state=42 for reproducibility

**Models Tested:**
1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with 100 trees, max_depth=10
3. **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting with 100 estimators, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=6
4. **Baseline Model**: Simple average of last 5 games

**Performance Metrics:**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Coefficient of Determination (R²)
- Cross-validation with mean and standard deviation

### 5. Pipeline Structure

**Scripts Created:**
- `02-data_preproc_canadian.py`: Data preprocessing for Canadian data
- `03-EDA_canadian.py`: Exploratory data analysis
- `04-model_fit_canadian.py`: Model training and evaluation
- `05-model_visualization_canadian.py`: Model performance visualization
- `06-baseline_comparison_canadian.py`: Comparison with rolling averages

**Makefile Updates:**
- Added `canadian` target for Canadian pipeline
- Maintains original NBA pipeline as `all` target
- Separate dependency chains for each dataset
